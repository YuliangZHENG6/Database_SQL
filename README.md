# Database_SQL

In the course of "Introduction to Database System", there is a course project through one semester.

In this project, a database schema was designed and implemented on Oracle SQL Developer for bibliographical management. As the literature resources were provided in a large amount, query optimizations were exhaustively explored to speed up execution.
